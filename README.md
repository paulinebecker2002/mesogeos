# Designing and Explaining Temporal Deep Learning Models for Wildfire Danger Prediction

This project focuses on **wildfire danger forecasting** using advanced **temporal deep learning models** combined with **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques, based on the [**Mesogeos** dataset](https://orionlab.space.noa.gr/mesogeos/) â€” a publicly available spatio-temporal datacube covering the Mediterranean region from 2006 to 2022 at a resolution of **1â€¯km Ã— 1â€¯km Ã— 1â€¯day**.

In this work, we evaluate multiple deep learning architectures (including LSTM, GRU, CNN, MLP, Transformer, Gated Transformer Network and Temporal Fusion Transformer) against a Random Forest baseline and apply state-of-the-art XAI methods to enhance interpretability.  

### Key XAI Analyses:
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Feature attribution and ranking across models, temporal dynamics of variable importance, and physical consistency checks with known wildfire drivers.
- **Integrated Gradients (IG):** Sample-level attributions for specific fire events and feature effect comparisons between models.
- **Accumulated Local Effects (ALE):** Non-linear feature sensitivity analysis to understand global variable impacts on predictions.
- **Case studies and interpretability metrics:** Detailed analysis of model predictions for significant fire events and comparison of explanation patterns.

These analyses not only provide accurate fire danger predictions but also offer insights into **how and why the models make their decisions**, bridging the gap between data-driven methods and domain knowledge in wildfire science.

## Data Repository

The dataset originates from **Mesogeos**.  
You can download it from the following Google Drive folder:

 **[Mesogeos Data Repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aRXQXVvw6hz0eYgtJDoixjPQO-_bRKz9)**

This folder includes:
- **`mesogeos_cube.zarr/`**: The full Mesogeos datacube  
- **`ml_tracks/`**: Contains the preâ€‘extracted datasets from Mesogeos that serve as the foundation of this project. We build upon these datasets by implementing additional models and extending the pipeline with explainable AI (XAI) analyses.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to access and process the Mesogeos datacube

## Training a Model

Install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file. 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To train a model (e.g., MLP), check if the dataset path to the "dataset_root" in the config files correspond to your correct path.

run:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/config_<model_name>/config_train.py
```

This will train the model and save the best checkpoint under saved/models as 'model_best.pth' and under saved/log a info.log file with all information about the trainings process. 

---

## Testing / Evaluation

1. Open the corresponding `config_test.py` file and update the `model_path` entry to point to the `model_best.pth` checkpoint.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python test.py --config configs/config_<model_name>/config_test.py
   ```

## Explainable AI (XAI)

We use **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** and **Integrated Gradients (IG)** to interpret the predictions of trained models.

### Compute SHAP:
```bash
python shap_local/compute_shap.py --config configs/config_<model_name>/config_train.py
```
### Compute IG:
python integrated_gradients/compute_ig.py --config configs/config_<model_name>/config_train.py

### Important config keys:
- **`checkpoint_path`**: Path to the trained model checkpoint (e.g., `model_best.pth`)  
- **`shap_path`**: Directory where SHAP and IG explanation outputs will be saved  

These scripts will generate feature attribution values for interpretability and store them for visualization.
